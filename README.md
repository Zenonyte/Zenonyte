Hi there, I'm Alo, going by the online alias Zenonyte!

I'm not proficient in anything <sup>yet</sup>, but I'm working on it!

Haven't worked on bigger projects as of right now, all of the stuff you can find on my page is stuff I've written to better myself (or to make my own life easier, the youtube video downloader being an example of that.)

If you like anything you see here, feel free to use it!

Wish to contact me? Throw me an e-mail at alo@ostumaa.com. 

Aaaand that's it for now, folks!
